Dumbell row drop set
Do some warm up sets (4-5) to get to our work set. The first set with the 150s I am more or less just grinding. As I lighten the weight though, I am doing all the pulling by driving my elbow up. If you can really learn this technique and focus, you will feel an intense burn and pump in your lats. So grind with the heavy dumbells, then lighten up and really focus on perfect execution by driving with elbows and flexing lat.

While your partner is unloading the weight, STRETCH those lats. After the drop nail another 6 reps + 4 forced, again while your partner unloads the weight stretch your lats.

Chest Week 9
`
So your legs need baby powder to prevent chaffing, your back can double for a parachute, let’s take your chest and shoulders to the next level!

We hit those groups on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday as we have been doing for all the areas that are under the high frequency plan.

I spread out legs and back to keep your lower back fresh. Your back will need a break after destroying it for the last 4 weeks, so I think you will also find this to be a welcome change from that perspective.

I cannot stress this enough……… we must keep to the RPE chart on Thursday and Saturday so we don’t murder your shoulders and rotator cuff. REMEMBER THAT!!! Be smart! You can’t get better if you are recovering from a serious injury.

Incline Dumbell press
Slow pyramid here today, after a few warm ups in the 12-15 range, start doing sets of 8 till you miss 8. Get a good stretch, then drive up to ¾ lockout. As usual we will count this as 3 working sets.

Chest Week 10
Week 2 of the high frequency for chest and shoulders! Your shirts should be feeling tighter at this point.

You can never have too much upper chest. Today even though all the exercises are incline, I want them to all be slightly different angles. Ideally you would just move up 1 hole on the adjustable bench with each exercise. So the dumbell press would be the least amount of incline, the barbell would be in the middle and the flye would be at the steepest angle.

Incline dumbell press
Just like last week use a slight incline on this if you can. See the video below to see the angle I prefer. Do sets of 8 until you get to a weight that you can barely do for 8. Take these to ¾ lockout. We will count this as 3 work sets.
